# Tensorised Probabilistic Programming

## Installation

We use Poetry for environment and package management.

1. [get Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
2. `poetry install`
3. `poetry shell`



## Notes:

- approximate posterior should be independent of data

TODOs:
- document that you have to be _really_ careful with dimensions in your programme.
- document how to set the dimensions for data!
